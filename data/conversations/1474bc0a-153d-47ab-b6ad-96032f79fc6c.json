It highlights the importance of a balanced team composition, including various roles like wicket-keeper-batsman, openers, middle-order batsmen, all-rounders, and bowlers. The list is extensive, featuring a diverse range of players, including legends like Sachin Tendulkar, MS Dhoni, and Kapil Dev, as well as more recent contributors like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma.\n\nOne potential weakness is the sheer number of players listed, which might make it difficult to distill the team's overall strategy and philosophy. Additionally, some players are included due to their \"legendary status\" rather than pure statistical analysis or match-winning performances. However, Response A compensates by emphasizing the need for individual contributions and team balance, providing a well-rounded selection.\n\nResponse B is a concise, factual list featuring notable players in each position. The inclusion of Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid, and Sourav Ganguly is a strength, as they add considerable skill to the batting lineup. However, the response falls short in terms of depth and explanation for some of the player selections. For instance, Ashish Nehra's inclusion as a bowler is justified, but the response does not detail his specific strengths or how he complements the team. Additionally, the absence of players like Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Yuvraj Singh in Response B makes the team's overall batting and all-round capabilities less well-rounded.\n\nResponse C stands out as a particularly well-structured and compelling selection, showcasing a clear understanding of the squad's overall strategy. The response prioritizes a modern, well-balanced team with an exceptional mix of experience, youth, and skills. The selection of Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj, and MS Dhoni at the top of the order provides an electrifying batting lineup. Furthermore, the all-rounder positions are carefully chosen to provide a dynamic, bowling-based middle order.\n\nOne potential weakness is the reliance on player records and tournament performances. Some of the reasoning behind specific player selections feels somewhat simplistic or formulaic. Nevertheless, Response C skillfully integrates its chosen players into a cohesive team while showcasing an outstanding awareness of the game's nuances.\n\nFINAL RANKING:\n1. Response C\n2.
