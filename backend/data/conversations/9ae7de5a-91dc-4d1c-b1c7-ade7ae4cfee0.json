Contemporary players like **Virat Kohli** are still building legacies that could shift opinions in the coming years.\n\nSo, while Tendulkar often tops the list, the \u201cgreatest\u201d ODI cricketer can vary depending on which criteria you value most."

          "response": "The greatest cricketer in ODI (One-Day Internationals) cricket is subjective and can be influenced by personal opinions and preferences. However, based on various rankings and expert opinions, I would suggest the following top contenders:\n\n1. **Sachin Tendulkar (India)**: Regarded by many as the greatest batsman in cricket history. He holds numerous ODI records, including the most runs scored (18,426) and centuries (49).\n2. **Sir Vivian Richards (West Indies)**: A dominant force in the 80s, Richards is known for his aggressive batting style and incredible statistics. He holds the record for the highest individual score in ODI cricket (189 not out).\n3. **AB de Villiers (South Africa)**: A versatile and innovative batsman, de Villiers is one of the most successful ODI players of all time. He holds the record for the fastest hundred (31 balls) in ODI cricket.\n4. **Virat Kohli (India)**: One of the most consistent and dominant batsmen in the modern era, Kohli has been a top performer in ODI cricket for over a decade. He holds the record for the most consecutive ODI centuries (7).\n5. **Rohit Sharma (India)**: A prolific run-scorer in ODIs, Sharma holds the record for the most centuries in a row (4) and is the fastest batsman to reach 10,000 ODI runs.\n\nOther notable players who could be considered among the greatest in ODI cricket include:\n\n* Brian Lara (West Indies)\n* Jacques Kallis (South Africa)\n* Hashim Amla (South Africa)\n* Chris Gayle (West Indies)\n* MS Dhoni (India)\n\nUltimately, the \"greatest\" cricketer is a matter of personal opinion and can be influenced by various factors such as team performance, individual achievements, and dominance over a specific period."

However, it contains a few factual inaccuracies in the statistics (e.g., the wicket count for Ricky\u202fPonting, the wicket total for Kumar\u202fSangakkara, and the score attributed to Sir\u202fVivian\u202fRichards). Despite these errors, the overall approach and breadth of content are commendable.\n\nResponse B lists several top contenders and gives a brief rationale for each. The response is concise and covers a good range of players, but it lacks depth and does not explore the criteria for greatness beyond simple ranking. It also contains some inaccuracies (e.g., the highest individual score in ODIs is 199* by Rohit Sharma, not 189* by Richards; the fastest hundred by AB\u202fde\u202fVilliers is 31 balls, but the claim that he holds that record is outdated). The answer would benefit from more nuanced analysis and clearer justification of each player\u2019s case.\n\nResponse C is short and to the point, declaring Sachin\u202fTendulkar as the greatest ODI cricketer and giving a few key reasons. While it is factually correct and succinct, it lacks depth, fails to discuss alternative viewpoints or criteria, and does not provide a balanced comparison with other players.

The council therefore looked at three key dimensions and then examined the most\u2011cited players against them.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  A practical rubric for \u201cgreatness\u201d\n\n| Criterion | Why it matters | How we weigh it (out of 5) |\n|-----------|----------------|---------------------------|\n| **Statistical volume** (runs, wickets, matches) | Shows sustained production over a long career. | 5 |\n| **Peak performance** (average, strike\u2011rate, economy, record\u2011breaking innings) | Indicates how dominant a player was at his best. | 4 |\n| **Impact on results** (World\u2011Cup wins, match\u2011turning performances, \u201cfinish\u2011ability\u201d) | The ultimate test of a player\u2019s value to his side. | 5 |\n| **Longevity / consistency** (career length, ability to stay at the top) | A great player should stay elite for many years. | 5 |\n| **Versatility / role** (batting + bowling, captaincy, fielding) | Adds extra weight for all\u2011rounders and leaders. | 3 |\n| **Era & conditions** (changes in pitches, equipment, rules) | Helps adjust raw numbers for fairness. | 2 |\n\nEach player is judged on these points; the highest\u2011scoring player across the board is usually regarded as the overall favorite, but strong showings in a subset of criteria can justify alternative choices.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Tendulkar dominates the *statistical volume* and *longevity* categories, while Ponting adds a strong *impact* factor through three World\u2011Cup victories and solid all\u2011round leadership.\n* **Close runners\u2011up:** Kohli, Dhoni and Rohit each score 21\u201120 points, excelling in *peak performance* and *impact* (Kohli\u2019s average, Dhoni\u2019s captaincy, Rohit\u2019s record innings).\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Council\u2019s final recommendation  \n\n> **If a single name must be given, the council agrees that Sachin\u202fTendulkar is the most widely\u2011accepted \u201cgreatest\u201d ODI batsman.**  \n> His 18,426 runs, 49 centuries, 23\u2011year career, and the way he carried India\u2019s innings for more than two decades give him the highest overall score in our rubric.\n\nHowever, **greatness is multi\u2011faceted**, and several other players make compelling cases:\n\n| Situation | Best\u2011fit player |\n|-----------|-----------------|\n| Most successful World\u2011Cup captain | **MS\u202fDhoni** (2 titles) |\n| Highest career ODI average (minimum 100 innings) | **Virat\u202fKohli** (\u224858) |\n| Most explosive strike\u2011rate & record\u2011breaking innings | **AB\u202fde\u202fVilliers** |\n| Highest individual ODI score | **Rohit\u202fSharma** (264) |\n| Premier all\u2011rounder in ODIs | **Shane\u202fWatson** |\n| Greatest power\u2011hitter | **Chris\u202fGayle** |\n\nThus the \u201cgreatest\u201d can be interpreted differently depending on what you value most\u2014raw volume, average, match\u2011winning ability, leadership, or pure power.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line for the user\n\n* **If you want the answer most cricket fans and analysts give:** **Sachin\u202fTendulkar**.  \n* **If you care about a specific attribute (e.g., captaincy, strike\u2011rate, highest score), see the table above for the player who leads that metric.**  \n\nThe council hopes this balanced, data\u2011driven overview helps you appreciate why the debate is lively and why multiple legends deserve recognition."
