It is concise and covers the fundamental concepts but lacks depth and breadth. The structure is flat, with repeated headings and some overlap (e.g., \u201cobject recognition\u201d and \u201cscene understanding\u201d are similar). It misses historical context, challenges, and recent advances like Vision Transformers or self\u2011supervised learning.

By turning raw pixels into structured knowledge, vision systems enable a huge variety of downstream tasks\u2014from detecting a stop sign in a self\u2011driving car to diagnosing a tumor in a medical scan.\n\nBelow is a concise yet complete picture of the field, merging the strongest points from the three model answers and the peer\u2011ranking feedback.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

First the eye captures light (acquisition), the brain cleans the signal (pre\u2011processing), then it recognises edges and shapes (feature extraction), identifies objects and their relationships (understanding), and finally decides what to do\u2014e.g., \u201cpick up the cup\u201d (decision).\n\n---\n\n## 2.
